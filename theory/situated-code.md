# Situated Code

Drawing on Donna Harawayâ€™s idea of "situated knowledges", we must treat every piece of code as a local, embodied act. Code is not universal. It emerges from specific tools, platforms, constraints, and values.

The programmer's terminal is a site of material and ideological entanglement.

Even a simple `for` loop carries with it the ghost of Turing and the abstraction of control. Our tools shape what we can express, and what remains unsayable.
